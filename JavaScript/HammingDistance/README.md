## Hamming Distance

Hamming distance is used to the Information Theory to calculate the number of bit positions that are different in two strings of equal length.

It's often used to detect errors when data is transmitted over a network.

## The algorithm

The algorithm takes as input 2 strings and checks if each character of the first string, is the same with the corresponding character of the second string. It returns the number of characters that are different.

## Examples

Input: sting1 = 'elena', string2 = 'elena'
Output: 0

Input: sting1 = '00110010', string2 = '10110011'
Output: 2
